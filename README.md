# AdventOfCode
Here you'll find my solutions for the AdventOfCode. These solutions aim to strike a balance between readbility, good practice & performance. You probably won't find any LINQ, complicated perf hacks or un-extendable code here (At least I try).


### Benchmarks
- Benchmarks are considered excluding I/O, Input is accessible as a raw string or a list of lines.
- If a solution have a parse method called from the constructor, you'll find a separate "Parse" benchmark listed.
- Results can be found in the README of each year, including the hardware that year was ran on.
