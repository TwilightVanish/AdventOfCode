# AdventOfCode
Here you'll find my solutions for the AdventOfCode. These solutions aim to strike a balance between readbility, good practice & performance. You probably won't find any LINQ, complicated perf hacks or un-extendable code here (At least I try).


### Benchmarks
- Ran on:
    - Intel Core i7-8750H CPU 2.20GHz (Coffee Lake), 1 CPU, 12 logical and 6 physical cores
    - Generic Single channel DDR4 2666 MHz 16GB
- Benchmarks are considered excluding I/O, Input in accessible as a raw string or a list of lines.
- If a solution have a parse method called from the constructor, you'll find a seperate "Parse" benchmark listed.
- Results can be found in the README of each year
